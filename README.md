------------------
Here’s an example of Python code to automate LinkedIn post generation, eBook creation, sales script creation, and a chatbot for customer inquiries as described in the job role for an AI Developer at a business coaching company. This code integrates with external tools like OpenAI for natural language generation, Typeform API for collecting inputs, and a simple chatbot using Flask for real-time customer inquiries. It also automates content workflows with Zapier or Integromat (Make).
1. Automating LinkedIn Post Generation (NLP with OpenAI API)

This Python code will generate LinkedIn posts based on trending topics using OpenAI's GPT-3 model:

import openai
import requests

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def generate_linkedin_post(trending_topic):
    prompt = f"Create a professional LinkedIn post about the topic: {trending_topic}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # GPT-3 model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    post_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return post_content

# Example usage
trending_topic = "AI in business coaching"
linkedin_post = generate_linkedin_post(trending_topic)
print("Generated LinkedIn Post:")
print(linkedin_post)

This function takes a trending topic as input and uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate a professional LinkedIn post.
2. Generating Customized eBooks Using Typeform Responses

We will use Typeform API to collect inputs for customized eBooks and then generate the eBook content dynamically.

import requests

# Typeform API setup (make sure you have the API key)
TYPEFORM_API_URL = "https://api.typeform.com/forms/{form_id}/responses"
API_KEY = "YOUR_TYPEFORM_API_KEY"

# Function to fetch responses from Typeform
def fetch_typeform_responses(form_id):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
    }
    response = requests.get(f"{TYPEFORM_API_URL.format(form_id=form_id)}", headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Function to generate eBook content
def generate_ebook_content(responses):
    # Process Typeform responses to generate personalized content
    # This can include creating sections based on responses and outputting as a formatted eBook (PDF/Word)
    ebook_content = "Customized eBook based on your inputs:\n\n"
    
    for response in responses['items']:
        ebook_content += f"Section: {response['answers']['text']}\n"
    
    return ebook_content

# Example usage
form_id = "YOUR_TYPEFORM_FORM_ID"
responses = fetch_typeform_responses(form_id)
ebook_content = generate_ebook_content(responses)
print(ebook_content)

Here, we assume the Typeform collects user inputs, which are then processed into content for the eBook. This can be expanded by converting the output to a PDF or Word document using libraries like ReportLab or python-docx.
3. Sales Script Generation Based on Client Inputs

Sales scripts can be dynamically created based on client-specific inputs using NLP:

import openai

# Function to generate a sales script
def generate_sales_script(client_profile):
    prompt = f"Generate a sales script for a business coach based on the following client profile: {client_profile}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # GPT-3 model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    
    sales_script = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return sales_script

# Example usage
client_profile = {
    "industry": "Retail",
    "goal": "Increase sales through AI integration",
    "budget": "Medium"
}
sales_script = generate_sales_script(str(client_profile))
print("Generated Sales Script:")
print(sales_script)

4. Chatbot Integration for Customer Inquiries Using Flask

For a real-time AI-driven chatbot on your website, you can use Flask to build a simple web app:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get('message')
    if not user_message:
        return jsonify({"error": "No message provided"}), 400
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=user_message,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    chatbot_reply = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return jsonify({"reply": chatbot_reply})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This Flask app accepts a POST request with a user message, processes it using GPT-3, and returns a chatbot reply. You can deploy this on a web server, and users can interact with the chatbot in real-time.
5. Workflow Automation with Zapier or Make (Integromat)

You can integrate these components (LinkedIn posts, eBooks, sales scripts, etc.) using Zapier or Integromat for automation:

    Zapier: Set up triggers like "new Typeform response" → "Generate LinkedIn Post" or "Send Email".
    Make (Integromat): Create automated workflows where the response from a form submission triggers the generation of an eBook, sends it to the client, and updates your CRM.

For example:

    Zapier Trigger: Typeform response submitted.
    Action 1: Generate eBook using Python or API call.
    Action 2: Send the eBook to the client via email.

Next Steps:

    Connect these tools: For a smooth AI-driven business coaching workflow, integrate the Python scripts with Zapier/Integromat for seamless automation.
    Implement client-focused automation: Based on inputs from clients, automate workflows to dynamically generate sales scripts, eBooks, and content.
    Iterate and Improve: Keep collecting data to improve AI models, automate more tasks, and enhance the AI chatbot’s performance over time.

Conclusion:

This code integrates various AI models for business coaching, including LinkedIn post generation, eBook creation, sales script generation, and chatbot automation. By leveraging Python, OpenAI API, Typeform, and Flask, we can automate processes and provide real-time, AI-driven solutions to clients. With platforms like Zapier or Make, you can integrate these tools into a smooth and scalable business workflow.
